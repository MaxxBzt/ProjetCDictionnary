### WARNING

Please change the path to the **`dictionaire_non_accentue file`** before launching the program. It can be found when doing `ctrl+F (cmd+F on mac)` in the **handleTrees.c**. 

#### HOW TO RUN

Just run as you normally would on your used IDE

### SHORTCUTS
* To test the _"Add a new word flechie to a base form"_ functionality (found in the search if a word is in a tree functionality) :\
Search for the word **"abaca"** then add your wanted flechie word to it. That word doesn't have many flechie words so the listing won't be long, and will be useful to check if the function works. 
* To test furthermore, you can re-select the functionality to search for a word, but this time, search for the flechie word that you just added, instead of the base word.

### TO BE REMINDED

* When generating random sentences based on the 'mots flechies', you might find some weird sentences because of the 'determinants". This
* is because there are many determinants other than 'les', 'la'. If you don't believe me, check in the dictionary file.
